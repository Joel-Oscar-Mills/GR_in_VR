# Usage

The GR in VR project can be used to fully calculate a trajectory along a geoedesic into a black hole or wormhole, and then produce a simulation of the view for an observer moving along this trajectory. The simulation is produced initially as a series of equirectangular frames, and then these frames are 'stitched together' into a video format, which is then able to be viewed using an Virtual Reality headset. The project is optimised for use on a HPC system, specifically one operating with the SLURM scheduler. As such, the setup may not be optimal for use on a personal computer. Further in this README, there is a discussion of how to change the code to better run it on a personal machine.
