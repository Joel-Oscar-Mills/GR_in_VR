This page contains instructions on how to display the final `.mp4` equirectangular video in VR.

- Get the [BlackHole]() file from the repository. 
- Open the file in the Unity Hub.
- Put the VR headset into rift mode.
- Drag the simulation videos into the assets.
- Drag the desired video into the videoplayer component.
- Play the desired simulation in Unity.

After this, you should be good to see the simulations in VR!
