# Features

Here are links to full simulation examples of the three main functionalities of this codebase:

### Schwarzschild Black Holes
For the full example simulation see [here](https://github.com/raichkel/GR_in_VR/blob/main/final_simulations/shwarzschild_black_hole.mp4). The files are large and so may have to be downloaded to be viewed.

### Kerr Black Holes
For the full example simulation see [here](https://github.com/raichkel/GR_in_VR/blob/main/final_simulations/kerr_black_hole_slower.mp4). The files are large and so may have to be downloaded to be viewed.


### Morris-Thorne Wormholes
For the full example simulation see [here](https://github.com/raichkel/GR_in_VR/blob/main/final_simulations/wormhole.mp4). The files are large and so may have to be downloaded to be viewed.
