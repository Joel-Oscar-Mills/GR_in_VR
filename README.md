# Black Holes in VR

###  Project using the Gradus package in Julia to display black holes using virtual reality. 

Trajectory of the observer is pre-computed using the Gradus package, and then passed to Unity, which will display the scenario in VR.

# Installation 
This project relies heavily on the [Gradus package](https://github.com/astro-group-bristol/Gradus.jl) which, in turn, relies on aspects of the [AstroRegistry](https://github.com/astro-group-bristol/AstroRegistry) AstroRegistry. The AstroRegistry can be added as follows:\
\
 `julia>] registry add https://github.com/astro-group-bristol/AstroRegistry`\
 \
 and then Gradus can be added by running:\
 \
 `julia>] add Gradus`\
`julia> using Gradus`

Loading Julia using the command line flag \

`--project="project"`\

will load in the necessary packages alongside this.
