- converting from wavelength to rgb

- look into using black body radiation to map colour and intensity
    - function describing temperature of accretion disc at various points
    - look into mapping this temperature to black body radiation
    - how bad/good of an approximation is this?
    - planck's law
    - top-down view of accretion disc for temperature distribution
    - or look up table of r, phi, or theta, t coordinates to see temp given coordinates
    - and then colour and intensity
    - able to redshift this
    - will give a continuous distribution of temp for accretion disc, can be generalised to thick and thin discs.


- Joel to push his comments and conversion rgb - wavelength code to the github

- produce one .mp4 but may need stereoscopic video - possibility to use 2 of the same frames for each eye?
    - make one for now and see how we go, may not be too difficult
